**Article**: *Yugi et al., 2014 - Cell Reports*:Reconstruction of Insulin Signal Flow from Phosphoproteome and Metabolome Data

1. What is the medically relevant insight from the article?

   The study provides insights into the metabolic regulatory network reactions that change through protein phosphorylation and metabolites during the acute action of insulin, a hormone crucial for maintaining metabolic homeostasis. The network analysis revealed that insulin induces the phosphorylation and activation of PFKL (liver-type phosphofructokinase 1), thereby regulating critical reactions in glycolysis. Additionally, it was found that utilizing phosphoproteome and metabolome data offers a versatile approach for reconstructing signal flow through the network.

2. Which genomics technology/ technologies were used?

   - **Phosphoproteomics**:It is used to study dynamic changes in protein phosphorylation. This method is used to identify kinases and phosphatases regulated by insulin.
   - **Metabolomics**: metabolomics is used to analyze the metabolic concentrations changes that occur in response to insulin signaling. 

3. List and explain at least three questions/ hypotheses you can think of that extend the analysis presented in the paper.

   **3-1** The KEGG pathway is limited to known pathways, so it may not capture the dynamics of novel or uncharacterized metabolites.

   **3-2** What kind of data is lost or omitted when moving from raw metabolic data to KEGG pathway mapping?

   **3-3** Is there any integration with genomics data in this process?
